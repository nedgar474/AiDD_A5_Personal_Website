                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>This is where you'll add your detailed biography, background, interests, and goals. Share your journey, what drives you, and what you're passionate about.</p>
                -->
                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>I earned my Bachelor of Science in Informatics from Indiana University’s Luddy School, where I focused on business applications of technology and led a capstone project 
                    developing an indoor mapping app for the IU Student Union. After graduation, I joined GEICO as a Systems Analyst, where I contributed to a major cloud migration 
                    initiative that improved scalability and reduced costs. I built reporting tools in Splunk and Power BI, supported QA testing, and helped modernize legacy systems 
                    using Azure and Duck Creek. In preparation for graduate study, I pursued independent projects in game development and trading strategy, which deepened my technical 
                    skills and broadened my analytical thinking. I’m now completing my Master of Science in Information Systems at the Kelley School of Business, where I’ve also earned 
                    a Certificate in Business Foundations to strengthen my strategic and financial acumen.</p>
                
                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>I’ve always been drawn to both analytical challenges and creative problem-solving. Over the last couple of years, 
                    I’ve focused on independent projects that reflect those interests—developing foundational 
                    gameplay mechanics in Unreal Engine 5 and researching trading strategies using technical analysis on platforms like TradingView. 
                    I enjoy diving into new tools and workflows, especially when they allow me to combine logic, design, and experimentation. Outside of my 
                    technical work, I spend time reading about cultural trends and social behavior, which gives me broader context for the systems and user 
                    experiences I help build. I also make time for golf and snowboarding—activities that help me stay focused, adaptive, and balanced.</p>
                
                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>As I near graduation, I’m looking for opportunities where I can apply both my technical background and business training to help organizations 
                    make smarter, data-informed decisions or lead system-level innovation. I’m particularly interested in roles that sit at the crossroads of technology 
                    transformation, business intelligence, and user-focused platform development. Long-term, I see myself growing into a leadership role where I can contribute 
                    to digital strategy, mentor cross-functional teams, and continue working with the evolving tools that first sparked my passion for this field.</p>
